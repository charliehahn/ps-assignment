## Postscript Analyst and Data Engineering Take-Home Assignments

Thanks for your application to Postscript! This homework is intended to mimic the type of work you may be expected to complete as a part of the team as either an Analyst or a Data Engineer. 

This project is left intentionally open-ended, but do not let that discourage you. We suggest you approach your solution(s) with the same mindset we use in our day-to-day - by applying our [core values](https://www.postscript.io/about-us/). This is intended to give us a handle on how you come up with solutions and design something that will solve the issue at hand. 

If you are unable to complete the assignment, that is completely OK. Be sure to annotate your work or write up a small segmment on what remains to be implemented and how you would go about wrapping things up. Be sure to consult your role-specific instructions for more information.

Both roles use the same core data set in order to mimic real life work. We do not expect the same output from an Analyst as we do a Data Engineer, but there is often a common starting point or overlap in skills. 

**Please do not spend more than 4 hours on this homework.**

Refer to the links below for more information based on the role to which you applied:

* [Senior Analyst](./senior-analyst/README.md)
* [Analyst](./analyst/README.md)
* [Data Engineer](/data-engineer/README.md)

### Data and Queries
All data required for the Senior Analyst, Analyst and Data Engineering projects are located in the `data` directory at the root of this repository. 

There are various files, which all can be logically combined based on PKs/FKs. Relationships should be clear based on naming conventions.

The `makefile` at the root of this repository includes various convenience commands which can be used to start a local Postgres DB (we use Snowflake for our actual warehouse, but PG is more convenient for projects like this). You'll want following installed locally for access:
- Docker Compose
- Python environment of your choice for any scripting or local development work

### Third Party Libraries
- *Senior Analyst* and *Data Engineer* applicants should be able to complete all of the work for this project with the packages currently included in the `requirements.txt`. You are welcome to introduce additional dependencies if you so choose. If you introduce additional dependencies, be sure to include them in the `requirements.txt` file
- *Analyst* applicants are expected to submit homework without additional dependencies, however can choose to include that analysis separately 

### Homework Delivery

Being a fully remote company, we value communication highly. As part of your submission, please include a [Loom video](https://www.loom.com) that highlights the broader themes you found in your analysis. You can walk us through your presentation, or indicate specific points of interest. Overall, we're interested in the story you are telling within your presentation, and want to hear it directly from you. 

The recording does not need to be longer than 3 minutes, though make sure to keep it under 5.

Upload your submission + Loom video link via the Greenhouse link attached to the original homework email that was sent to you. 

We will recieve a notification, so please do not email your files to us! If you run into trouble submitting your work, please contact grace@postscript.io
