# Charlie Hahn's Postscript Take Home Assignment

This is the data exploration and analysis I've put together for the senior analyst role.

**List of Technologies Used:**
1. sqlpad gui (for data wrangling/analysis)
2. tableau (for data viz)

**Tableau Dashboard:**
- https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/charlie3118/viz/ps_dashboard/postscript_dash

**Canva Presentation:**
- https://www.canva.com/design/DAEkLLiKo0I/T1L_iARCLpWuIZg2W-1JoA/view?utm_content=DA[â€¦]tm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton

**Video Presentation:**
- https://www.loom.com/share/af4b570bdf5e41ac9a6320b96ae7ae60

**Roughly how long the project took**
- ERD Understanding + Creation: ~15 mins
- Research Postscript Business: ~1 hour
- EDA & Modeling: ~2 + hours
- Tableau: ~1+ hour
- Thinking in my sleep: ?
- Presentation: ~30 mins
- Video: ~10 mins
- **Total:** 4+ hours (I went over time! This project was just really fun to work on!)

**How to orchestrate delivery to production?**
- dbt to refine raw data from snowflake with staging, intermediate, and marts data models + schema and data tests
- Airflow to test and push refined data back into snowflake
- Snowflake to Looker integration to provide self-service analytics for all

# Entity Relationship Diagram
Using dbdiagram.io, I've created this ERD based off the provided datasets. Some light exploration was done to figure out the linkages.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

All data exploration and transformation was done using the `sqlpad` gui. I updated the `docker-compose.yml` and `makefile` to include this additional service.

**Observation:**
44% (888/2000) of industry values are missing in the `shop` table, which is a sizable amount. As a result, I'd be wary of using this data to create industry average values and/or comparing any one store against aforementioned industry averages.

General flow of customer purchase journey (with exceptions):
1. shop subscribes for postscript `shops`
2. customers profiles get set up in each shop `customers`
3. shops send messages to customers `messages`
4. message links are viewed and/or clicked by customers `link_clicks`
5. customers purchase orders `orders`
6. order is attributed to a postscript marketing message `attribution`

# Appendix

**Given more time I would look deeper into the following:**
- How do shops compare to the industry average as an index for sales/messages/click through/attribution etc

- Add customer level data so stores can see which customer is giving the highest ROI to create custom-tailored retargeting strategies

- Look at on average, how long did it take a customer to click on a link after receiving a message?

- Why are there multiple clicks? Do more clicks lead to higher attribution rates or conversion rates - all the way through the funnel

- Funnel: # customers - % of customers who receive a message - % who click on a link within message - % who eventually purchase

- Look at orders created with postscript messages vs without.  Which is better overall for customers?

- Which is bringing in more revenue?  Can apply statistical a/b test and get p-value for significance
