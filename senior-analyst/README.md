#EDIT FOR DEV TEST
## Postscript Senior Analyst Take-Home Assignment

### Goals and To-Dos
- Provide example ecommerce performance analysis based on intepretation of a novel data set
- This project will require you consider the full BI stack, from raw data to transformation to end analyst output
- Translate your analysis into output consumable by non-technical business users using whatever media you see fit

#### Data Transformation
- As a fully remote organization, we aim for self-service across our customer-facing products and our internal tools. BI at Postcript is no different. Part of this self-service is enablement; we want analysts to own the definition and creation of useful data models for end users
- **To Do**:
  - If you were to use the provided data to define a "fact" table (or tables) to enable better end-user analysis, what would this table look like? How would you orchestrate delivery to production? 

#### Analysis
There are numerous ecommerce and SaaS metrics which are well defined and understood across the industry. **Given the dataset we've provided**:
- Choose 3 - 5 metrics you believe are most relevant to shops that use Postscript
- Using whatever tools you so choose (SQL, pandas, etc), run your analysis for these metrics on the data provided
- In addition to running this analysis, please create a presentation (Google Slides, Canva, etc are more than sufficient) that explain the outcome of your analysis and the reasoning behind your analysis decisions

### Third Party Libraries
If you choose to use libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for visualization, please see the notes regarding **Third Party Libraries** in the root [README](../README.md)

### Evaluation Criteria
While each role is different, there is overlap in how we evaluate problem solving and delivery. Criteria includes:
- Speed & Resourcefulness
- Demonstrating autonomous decision making
- Quality given the amount of time taken
- Ability to communicate complex technical topics
- Understanding of how this solution affects others working in/ with BI at Postscript

### Delivery
Please send us:
1. A link to your analysis code on Github, or a zip file of your code 
2. Your presentation and explain of your analysis 
3. Any additional commentary your have around ecommerce analysis and BI at an ecommerce SaaS company
4. List of technologies used, and technologies or patterns that you would introduce into a project like this if you were given more time
5. Roughly how long the project took 

Please upload your submission via the Greenhouse link attached to the original homework email that was sent to you. We will recieve a notification, so please do not email your files to us! If you run into trouble submitting your work, please contact grace@postscript.io

**Note**
- If you are unable to complete the tasks listed in a reasonable timeframe, please include a write-up of how you would expand upon your completed work if given more time. You will not be penalized if you are unable to address every item in this project. We are most interested in understanding how you approach problem solving and how you would take action to identify solutions
